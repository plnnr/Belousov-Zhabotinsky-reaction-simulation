This code is a python and javascript implementation of the original code written in Java. To run, open index.html in your browser. You can view a live demo [here](https://plnnr.github.io/Belousov-Zhabotinsky-reaction-simulation/).

The black textbox is drag-able. It doesnt work well on a mobile device right now.
